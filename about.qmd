title: "About Me"

---
Hello, My name is Joseph Silveira.
I was born and raised in the Central Valley. I grew up playing soccer, baseball and football.
I grew up on my dads farm in Atwater before moving to Riverbank in 2018. I graduated highschool in 2020, and went straight into CSUCI the following Fall for Mechatronic Engineering. I am very excited about my degree and hope to get a masters degree in engineering design. My dream job is making aftermarket parts for automobiles.
