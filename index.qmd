This is about me.
My name is Joseph Silveira. I am a Mechatronic engineering Major. I wanted to get into Mechatronics because I was exposed to a robotic start up when I was a sophmore in high school. I like mechatronics becasue it gives me the opportunity to learn hands on and do more labs than homework. I also have several hobbies. I am on the CSUCI sailing team and I like to skate, but i'm not very good at it.
